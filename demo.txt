ctrlPoolDemo.py will run a demonstration script that simply reads all
the CCDs of a single visit using multiple cores, and print the total
number of pixels that were read.  Below are some example command-lines.
Note that these are relevant for processing HSC data on the cluster
at Princeton, and will need small modifications for processing other
data on other clusters (specifically, the path to the data repo; and
the "--id" arguments for specifying which data to read).

* Run the demo on a single machine (SMP = Symmetric Multi-Processing):

    ctrlPoolDemo.py /tigress/HSC/HSC --rerun=price/dm-4835 --id visit=1224 --job=demo --batch-type=smp --cores=7

* Run the demo under Slurm:

    ctrlPoolDemo.py /tigress/HSC/HSC --rerun=price/dm-4835 --id visit=1224 --job=demo --batch-type=slurm --cores=112 --time=5
